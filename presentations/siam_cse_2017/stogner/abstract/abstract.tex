LibMesh: Past, Present, and Future

An introduction to the design and development process of the libMesh
Finite Element Library.  Beginning with the history of libMesh
collaboration, this talk discusses the software development challenges
posed by an ever-increasing variety of use cases, growing user base,
and distributed collaboration between developers with separate goals
at a variety of institutions.  Interactions with the wider software
ecosystem of third party dependencies and dependent applications and
middleware are also explored.  Many of the design decisions in
libMesh and their evolution are discussed, and the talk will conclude
with a few examples of upcoming library development directions and
features.
